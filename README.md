# Machine Learning Models

This repository contains several machine learning models implemented in Python. These models are commonly used for various tasks, including linear regression, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest, decision tree, and classification.

## Models Included

1. Linear Regression
   - Description: Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm used to predict a continuous target variable based on one or more input features.

2. Logistic Regression
   - Description: Logistic regression is a classification algorithm used to predict categorical outcomes by estimating the probabilities using a logistic/sigmoid function.

3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   - Description: K-nearest neighbors is a non-parametric classification algorithm that predicts the class of a sample based on the majority vote of its k nearest neighbors.

4. Random Forest
   - Description: Random forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions by averaging or voting.

5. Decision Tree
   - Description: A decision tree is a flowchart-like structure where each internal node represents a feature, each branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents the outcome.

6. Classification
   - Description: This file contains utility functions for classification tasks, including data preprocessing, feature extraction, model evaluation, and performance metrics.
